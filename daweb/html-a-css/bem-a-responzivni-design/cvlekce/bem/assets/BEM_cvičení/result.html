              Skasgaden is perhaps best known for the intricate patterns in the
              sand where a small stream flows into the ocean. One could spend
              hours walking and seeing new patterns/angles the entire time. The
              rest of the beach is a beautiful golden-sand beach that makes for
              a nice walk.

              Cartagena is a city that is located on the shores of the Caribbean
              Sea, in the northwestern part of the South American continent. If
              you are wondering where is Cartagena in Colombia, it is located in
              the north of the country and is the capital of the Bolívar region.

              Stunning beaches border tropical rainforests and towering
              cathedrals share skyline with an imposing volcano. Tourists and
              residents crowd the store-lined streets and restaurant-filled back
              alleys of Fort-de-France, while a few miles north, foliage dampens
              the sounds of bird tweets and hikers. In a word: Martinique.

              Sometimes referred to as a “forest of stone,” the beautiful Bryce
              Canyon hoodoos stand frozen in time, delicate yet nearly eternal,
              like the facial expressions of Goldie Hawn. Just seeing them is
              something to behold, but you’re gonna wanna do more than just
              look.

              Ninh Binh province is located in northern Vietnam, about 100km
              south of Hanoi. With its hundreds of limestone cliffs emerging
              from the ground scattered across the rice fields, this region is
              appropriately nicknamed the “Halong Bay in land”.
